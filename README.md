# Go Roc

```sh
roc build.roc
```

```sh
roc --prebuilt-platform app.roc
```

Just wondering what I can do different when implementing my R2E lib as a platform.

## Compatibility

Tested only with a:
- MacOS arm 
- Linux x64

To build this, you will need:
- zig
- golang

## Misc

This platform downloads ~150MB at the first start - "chrome for testing" and chromedriver.
